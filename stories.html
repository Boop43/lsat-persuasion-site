Andrew has been the best tutor I could have possibly asked for. He has been knowledgeable, responsive, and able to explain complex concepts in clear and engaging ways. I look forward to the lessons that fit my specific needs. I’m also given homework assignments that Andrew assesses throughout the week to identify weak spots that I wouldn’t have spotted myself. He is also open to texting if I need to talk to him between sessions. Before I met Andrew, I didn’t know what or how to study. Now, I have guidance and feel confident in my studying.
He helped me see how truly learnable (and honestly kind of fun) the LSAT is; my diagnostic was a 148. As of right now, I am scoring around 165 in my practice tests and still improving. Not only is Andrew a fantastic tutor, he is also a fantastic human being, and I consider myself very lucky to have him in my corner!
