  <p>“Andrew has been the best tutor I could have possibly asked for. He has been knowledgeable, responsive, and able to explain complex concepts in clear and engaging ways. I look forward to the lessons that fit my specific needs.
  
  I’m also given homework assignments that Andrew assesses throughout the week to identify weak spots that I wouldn’t have spotted myself. He is also open to texting if I need to talk to him between sessions.
  
  Before I met Andrew, I didn’t know what or how to study. Now, I have guidance and feel confident in my studying. He helped me see how truly learnable (and honestly kind of fun) the LSAT is; my diagnostic was a <strong>148</strong>. As of right now, I am scoring around <strong>165</strong> in my practice tests and still improving.
  
  Not only is Andrew a fantastic tutor, he is also a fantastic human being, and I consider myself very lucky to have him in my corner!”</p>

  <p>“If you are seeking to boost your test confidence, become more disciplined, and learn new approaches to tackle the LSAT, Andrew is the one! After only one month of sessions with Andrew, I became much more comfortable with how I approached the test and viewed things from an entirely new perspective — one much less scary and a lot more fun.
  
  The sessions were enlightening, engaging, and left me motivated to do more. Andrew works with you one-on-one to better understand your weaknesses and to make you the ultimate LSAT expert! I was merely looking for someone to look over my mistakes and provide me with LSAT tips, but Andrew truly exceeded what I was looking for.
  
  There is no better feeling than mastering certain question types you originally thought were impossible. Working full-time made my study routine challenging, but Andrew offers flexible scheduling that works for you. Best of all, he will keep you on top of things with regular check-ins.
  
  Thank you Andrew for all your wisdom and care!”</p>

  <p>“To whom it may concern, I’d highly recommend Andrew as a tutor for the LSAT! Andrew tutored me for several months and helped me build a strong fundamental understanding of the LSAT, which ultimately led to my success.
    
  If you’re looking for a tutor who focuses on practical methods rather than overly complicated diagrams or question types, Andrew is the one you need. I saw a noticeable increase in both my LSAT score and my grasp of the material.
  
  He’s a great tutor, and I would definitely recommend him to anyone!”</p>
