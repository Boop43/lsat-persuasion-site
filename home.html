      <h3>Consultation Session</h3>
      <p class="price">$20 for 20 minutes</p>

      <h3>One-on-One LSAT Tutoring</h3>
      <p class="price">$100 per hour</p>
      <p class="desc">Each session runs approximately 90 minutes, or shorter if needed. Every session is customized to your needs. You’ll learn how to approach Logical Reasoning the right way. After each session, you’ll receive assignments tailored to your weaknesses. These are checked by the instructor throughout the week to monitor your progress and make adjustments if needed. Your next session will be planned based on the strengths and weaknesses revealed in those assignments.
The service also includes ongoing support between sessions. If you're ever unsure about what to do, need clarification, or want to adjust your study plan, the instructor will be available to guide you. This daily attention and personalized care outside of sessions is one of the many things that make LSAT Persuasion distinct.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A 60-minute base fee must be paid prior to the session. Session fees are adjusted by the minute based on the actual session length. Any additional time beyond 60 minutes will be billed after the session. Sessions will almost never exceed 90 minutes unless absolutely necessary, in which case the student’s consent will be requested in advance.
