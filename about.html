  <p>I’m Andrew Kim, the founder of LSAT Persuasion. I will be a 1L at Georgetown University Law Center in the Fall of 2025. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2024, where I majored in Philosophy with a minor in Law. Before that, I served in the U.S. Army for 4 years as an enlisted Soldier.</p>
  <p> When I first began my LSAT journey, I was fully prepared to put in the work, determined to dedicate all my time and effort. I soon encountered a problem: I didn’t quite know how to study. I hired tutors, paid for well-known prep materials and online platforms, but I often received conflicting instructions on how to approach the LSAT. For the first two months, I actually saw a decrease in my score—I was so defeated.</p>

  <p>After months of trial and error, I began to see the test differently. What once felt like a set of frightening logical riddles began to look all the same: it is always one person simply trying to <strong>persuade</strong> me of an idea, usually with a terrible <strong>pitch</strong>. And the gap? It’s always right there in the passage. Always. </p>

  <p>I have seen many friends study hard but focusing on the wrong things, only to end up declaring, “The LSAT is an IQ test.” I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that the LSAT, when studied correctly, is easier than most people think. </p>

  <p>I am eager to share everything I know about the LSAT. Studying hard is only halfway; the other half is seeing and studying the LSAT in the right way.
