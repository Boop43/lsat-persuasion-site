  <p>I’m Andrew Kim, the founder of LSAT Persuasion. I will be a 1L at Georgetown University Law Center in the Fall of 2025. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2024, where I majored in Philosophy with a minor in Law. Before that, I served in the U.S. Army for 4 years as an enlisted Soldier.</p>
  <p> When I first began my LSAT journey, I was fully prepared to put in the work, determined to dedicate all my time and effort. I soon encountered a problem: I didn’t quite know how to study. I hired tutors, paid for well-known prep materials and online platforms, but I often received conflicting instructions on how to approach the LSAT. For the first two months, I actually saw a decrease in my score—I was so defeated.</p>

  <p>After 8 months of trial and error, I began to see the test differently. What once felt like a set of frightening logical riddles began to look all the same: it is always one person simply trying to <strong>persuade</strong> me of an idea, usually with a terrible <strong>pitch</strong>. And the gap? It’s always right there in the passage. Always. </p>

  <p>I have seen many friends study hard but focusing on the wrong things, only to end up declaring, “The LSAT is an IQ test.” I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that the LSAT, when studied correctly, is easier than most people think. </p>

  <p>I am eager to share everything I know about the LSAT. Studying hard is only halfway; the other half is seeing and studying the LSAT in the right way.
<strong>How will the session go?</strong> </p>

<p>I’ll start by learning everything I can about you—your habits, your comprehension skills, your logical weak spots. Then, I’ll teach you how to approach and think about the LSAT. I normally start with Logical Reasoning. 
</p>

<p>Between sessions, you’ll assign homework tailored to your weaknesses, challenging enough to push you, but never overwhelming. I’ll check in on your homework throughout the week and provide feedback even outside of our sessions.
</p>

<p>You’ll always know exactly what to study, how to study it, and receive lessons that are tailored to your needs based on your submitted homework. After just one session, all of my current students felt they were finally on the right track. After two or three weeks, many begin to see Logical Reasoning in a completely new way. I hope you can join us, too!
