  <h2>How will the session go?</h2>
<p>I’ll start by learning everything I can about you—your habits, your comprehension skills, your logical weak spots. Then, I’ll teach you how to approach and think about the LSAT. I normally start with Logical Reasoning. 
</p>

<p>Between sessions, you’ll be assigned homework tailored to your weaknesses, challenging enough to push you, but never overwhelming. I’ll check in on your homework throughout the week and provide feedback even outside of our sessions.
</p>

<p>You’ll always know exactly what to study, how to study it, and receive lessons that are tailored to your needs based on your submitted homework. After just one session, all of my current students felt they were finally on the right track. After two or three weeks, many begin to see Logical Reasoning in a completely new way. I hope you can join us, too!
