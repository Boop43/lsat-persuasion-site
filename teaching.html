    <h2>How I Teach</h2>
    <p>I’ll start by learning everything I can about you—your habits, your strengths, your weak spots. Then, I’ll teach you how to approach and think about the LSAT. Between sessions, you’ll get homework tailored to your weaknesses, challenging enough to push you, but never overwhelming. I’ll check in on your homework throughout the week and provide feedback even outside of our sessions.</p>
    <p>You’ll always know exactly what to study, how to study it, and receive lessons that are not arbitrarily prepared but tailored to you based on your submitted homework. After just one session, all of my current students felt they were finally on the right track. After two or three weeks, many began to see Logical Reasoning in a completely new way.</p>
